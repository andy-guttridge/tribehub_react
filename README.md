## Site goals
TribeHub is designed to be a virtual equivalent to the typical wall planner a family might put up in a kitchen or other communal area. The primary goals of the web app are to:
1) Provide busy families with a single, central hub around which to plan and organise busy lives and schedules. This should include calendar/event scheduling functionality similar to a family wall planner, enabling events to be scheduled for one or multiple family members, and viewed by all the family.
2) Deliver a simple and intuitive user experience, suitable for adults and tech literate children aged 10+. 
3) Offer a minimal set of impactful features chosen in order to deliver a useful app within an achievable development timeframe, while laying a solid foundation for additional features in the future.
