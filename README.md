# TribeHub

## Project goals
TribeHub is designed to be a virtual equivalent to the typical wall planner a family might put up in a kitchen or other communal area. The primary goals of the web app are to:
1) Provide busy families with a single, central hub around which to plan and organise busy lives and schedules. This should include calendar/event scheduling functionality similar to a family wall planner, enabling events to be scheduled for one or multiple family members, and viewed by all the family.
2) Deliver a simple and intuitive user experience, suitable for adults and tech literate children aged 10+. 
3) Offer a minimal set of impactful features chosen in order to deliver a useful app within an achievable development timeframe, while laying a solid foundation for additional features in the future.

### Lighthouse testing

Lighthouse testing revealed that button elements did not have id attributes which are required by assistive technologies. These were added to all buttons, with programatically generated unique values where required for components which are rendered multiple times.


### Accessability testing

Wave testing revealed contrast issues with buttons. The text colour for buttons in the primary and secondary colour was lightened, while outline buttons were changed from primary to a dark (or light for dark mode) colour, and the font size was increased for all buttons. This resolved the contrast issues.

Contrast issues were also detected between the dots on the calendar indicating where there are events for a given day. This was more difficult to address, because the calendar cells can have a number of different colours depending on their current state. After some experimentation, the `mix-blend-mode` attribute with a value of `difference` was used on these elements to invert their colour against that of the background. This means the colour of these indicators might not fit as well with the colour scheme of the site, but it guarantees there will be no contrast issues.

Wave testing also highlighted that avatar images throughout the website had the same text for the alt attribute. This was addressed by passing a `displayName` prop through to the Avatar component, and using this to generate an appropriate alt text value for each user.

The Wave validator also several form elements with no label on the profile update form and the event search form (caused by a missing or incorrect ids on input elements), and one element with a duplicate id on the contacts form (caused by a naming clash with another element on the add event form).
The label containing the notifications indicator was found to contain no text. This was rectified by putting a `<span>` element with the Tailwind CSS `sr-only` class inside the label, providing a read out of the number of notifications present for screen readers but visually hidden. This label was also flagged as orphaned from its form control by the Wave validator, however this was not fixed, as the label is used instead of a button for the DaisyUI dropdown component in order to overcome a bug with Safari.

Missing labels were found for the input elements which are part of the DaisyUI collapse components used to reveal further detail for each calendar event. This was rectified by passing the unique key value generated for each CalEvent instance as a `calEventId` prop, using this to generate a unique id for each input and associating a screen reader only label to each one.

The Wave report contained an alert about the `noscript` element. This was to flag that content within this element must be accessible. Since the element contains a simple text reminder that JavaScript must be enabled to use the website, this was deemed not to be an issue.

Wave flagged skipped heading levels in the notification items menu and on calendar events. The former was addressed by changing the `h3` elements used in the `NotificationItem` component to `h2` and styling to look like `h3`. The headings for event titles on calendar events were changed from `h4` to `h3`, which would appear to be correct as the next heading above them is an `h2`, however this did not resolve the validator error. `h2` and `h1` were also tested for these headings, but this still did not resolve the error. These elements were then changed to `p` and the error was resolved. The `h5` headings within the 'details' collapse component at the bottom of calendar events were also changed to `p` elements to resolve similar errors.

The wave report that the category icons on calendar events did not have unique text for the `alt` attribute. This was due to a bug rather than an oversight, and was corrected. Wave then flagged a 'redundant alternative text' alert, meaning that another nearby element had an image with the same `alt` text. This is because more than one event in the list of events had the 'shopping' category - given the purpose and meaning of the icon, a repeat occurence of the alt text is correct and was deemed not to be an issue.

### Resolved bugs
- During implementation of the `NotificationItem` component, requests to the REST API for the data for the events with which each notification is associated were frequently resulting in an HTTP 500 internal server error. A version of the API running on a development server was used for debugging. This revealed that the number of simultaneous requests for data coming from a large number of NotificationItems was overwhelming the free tier ElephantSQL database server. The fix was to add the full data for each event to the notification JSON served by the API, which meant that only one network request was required to fetch the notification and event data together. 
- During testing, a large amount of empty space was noted at the bottom of each page, but only for some user accounts. No elements causing this could be identified using the Chrome developer tools, and elements were manually removed from each component until the culprit was found. This revealed that the unordered list of norifications inside the DaisyUI dropdown component used for the notifications menu was taking up vertical space in the document even when closed/not visible. This was only noticeable for users with a large number of notifications and hence a very long list inside the menu. The issue was addressed by applying the Tailwind CSS hidden class to the unordered list when not visible. An event listener was added to detect clicks outside of the menu and close the list accordingly.
